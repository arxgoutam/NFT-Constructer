                These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use
                of the Xhibiter website(s), our APIs, mobile app (the “App”),
                and any other software, tools, features, or functionalities
                provided on or in connection with our services; including
                without limitation using our services to view, explore, and
                create NFTs and use our tools, at your own discretion, to
                connect directly with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs
                on public blockchains (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in
                these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item
                implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain),
                which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated
                with certain content or data. For purposes of these Terms,
                “user”, “you”, and “your” means you as the user of the Service.
                If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity
                then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and
                warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the
                entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and
                (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

              <p className='urbanist-black-16'>
                PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN
                IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED
                IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION

                EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED
                THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN

                Xhibiter is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial
                institution, or creditor. Xhibiter provides a peer-to-peer web3
                service that helps users discover and directly interact with
                each other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not
                have custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are
                interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases,
                transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a
                third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on
                blockchains.
              </p>
              <p className='urbanist-black-16'>
                Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need
                to provide additional terms for specific services (and such
                services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall
                also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and
                conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then
                become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.
                In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any
                additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
                service, such additional terms shall control for that specific
                service.
